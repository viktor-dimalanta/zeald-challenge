Zeald PHP Tests (Short Version)
Please complete each of the tasks to the best of your ability.


Please attempt them in order.
If you run out of your time it is best to complete one test completely than half-complete multiple tests.
However, if you are unable to answer a particular question, just leave it & move on.
We have provided one optional test which you can look at if you have available time.
You will be provided access to a sample MySQL database called 'nba2019' - more detail on this database can be found below. 
To simplify database access, you can directly query the database using a global method called query which receives a string $sql. This will execute the SQL on the database, and any return value will be returned as an array of associative array's - representing the query resultset.
If you are familiar with Laravel collections, a standalone version of this class is included by the framework and is available via the global collect method.
To inspect variables you can use the global dd method (taken from Laravel). This will dump the variable contents to your screen & allow you to inspect arrays, objects etc. E.g. dd($resultset);
